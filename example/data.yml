    This document is prepared using LaTeX2e\cite{Lamport94} and shows the desired format and appearance of a manuscript prepared for the Proceedings of the SPIE.\footnote{The basic format was developed in 1995 by Rick Hermann (SPIE) and Ken Hanson (Los Alamos National Lab.).} It contains general formatting instructions and hints about how to use LaTeX.  The LaTeX source file that produced this document, {\ttfamily article.tex} (Version 3.4), provides a template, used in conjunction with {\ttfamily spie.cls} (Version 3.4). These files are available on the Internet at \url{https://spie.org/Documents/Publications/spie-proceedings-style.zip}.  The font used throughout is the LaTeX default font, Computer Modern Roman, which is equivalent to the Times Roman font available on many systems.
